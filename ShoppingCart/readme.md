## Overview

**Shopping Cart**:

**Project Description**: This is a c++ command line based shopping cart application that simulates basic transactions. It allows the users to view the store inventory, add items into your cart, view your cart, and complete purchases through checkout. When you checkout the program exports the data to receipt.txt for the user to read.

**Project Goals**: 
- My main goal for this project was to learn the basics of c++ and apply that to a working project.
- Build a functional console-based program from scratch
- Simulate real-world use in the checkout function
- Gain experience in XCode
- Gain expereince without version control

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Open ShoppingCart.xcodeproj in XCode
2. Ensure that store.txt is include and is marked as a target to ShoppingCart
3. Click the run button or command r

Instructions for using the software:

1. Choose option 1 to view available store items
2. Choose option 2 to add items to your cart(type name to add to cart and 0 to exit infinite loop)
3. Choose option 3 to review your cart and subtotal
4. Choose option 4 to checkout by entering a payment amount
5. Choose option 5 to exit the program

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* macOS with XCode 15+
* C++ Standard: C++17 or newer
* No external libraries required - uses STL instead

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [official documentation](https://cplusplus.com/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add quantity limits for items in store inventory
* [ ] Add tax calculation and total summary
* [ ] Track customer order history across sessions
